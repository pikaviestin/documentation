# Documentation

Matrix-ax service related plans &amp; documentation lives here. Matirx.ax is a free-to-use Matrix instant messenger service for Finnish users hosted as a community effort.

Most of the docs shall be in the [Wiki](https://github.com/matrix-ax/documentation/wiki)

Project website shall be written in Finnish due to the targeted user base, but technical plans and other materials may as well be written in English, when preferred.

The ak_* ones need to be commented out if you want to test it out outside Authentik and to change the return.
